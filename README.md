This is the official Laravel SDK for [App:keep](https://appkeep.dev)

## Installation

Install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require appkeep/laravel-appkeep
```

Add the project key you obtain from Appkeep to your .env file:

```dotenv
APPKEEP_PROJECT_KEY=<your-project-key>
```

> ðŸš¨ Make sure you have set up scheduled commands (`php artisan schedule:run`). Appkeep relies on Laravel's schedule runner to work.

## Set up health checks

```php
// 1. Import this trait
use Appkeep\Laravel\Concerns\RunsChecks;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    // 2. Add this trait to your class
    use RunsChecks;

    // ...

    public function boot()
    {
        // 3. Insert these lines
        if ($this->app->runningInConsole()) {
            $this->registerDefaultChecks();
        }
    }
```

## Advanced

### List of checks

Run this command to see a list of configured health checks:

```bash
php artisan appkeep:checks

# +----------------+------------+
# | Check          | Expression |
# +----------------+------------+
# | DatabaseCheck  | * * * * *  |
# | DiskUsageCheck | * * * * *  |
# +----------------+------------+
```

### One application, multiple servers

If you are running your Laravel site on multiple hosts behind a load balancer, simply put the respective name of each host in your .env file.

```dotenv
APPKEEP_SERVER_NAME=eu-server1
```

### Writing your own checks
