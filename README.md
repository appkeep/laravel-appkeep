This is the official Laravel SDK for [App:keep](https://appkeep.co)

## Installation

- **Supported PHP versions**: 7.4, 8.0, 8.1
- **Supported Laravel versions**: 7.x, 8.x, 9.x

#### 1. Install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require appkeep/laravel-appkeep
```

#### 2. Initialize Appkeep

```bash
php artisan appkeep:init
```

This will publish the config file and configure default checks. You can later change these default checks from `app/Providers/AppkeepProvider.php`.

ðŸ’¡ **Important:** Execute the following steps on your production environment.

#### 3. Set up a cronjob

Make sure you have a cronjob that runs `php artisan schedule:run` every minute. App:keep relies on Laravel's scheduler. See Laravel's [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/scheduling#running-the-scheduler) to learn more.

#### 4. Sign in to Appkeep

This step simply helps set your `APPKEEP_KEY` env variable. If you know the key, you can add it into your `.env` file yourself.

To sign in / register and create a project key, simply run:

```bash
php artisan appkeep:login
```

## Commands

Here's other commands that you might find useful:

### List all checks

Run this command to see a list of configured health checks:

```bash
php artisan appkeep:list

# +----------------+------------+
# | Check          | Expression |
# +----------------+------------+
# | DatabaseCheck  | * * * * *  |
# | DiskUsageCheck | * * * * *  |
# +----------------+------------+
```

## Advanced

### Customize checks

By default, Appkeep will register some default checks for you with some sensible defaults. You can adjust their warning and failure tresholds, or register your own checks in your `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php` file.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Appkeep\Laravel\Checks\DiskUsageCheck;
use Appkeep\Laravel\Facades\Appkeep;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function boot()
    {
        // Uncomment this to remove all default checks
        // Appkeep::forgetDefaultChecks();

        Appkeep::checks([
            DiskUsageCheck::make()
                ->warnIfUsedPercentageIsAbove(60)
                ->failIfUsedPercentageIsAbove(70),

            // Register other checks, including custom ones...
        ]);
    }
}
```

### One application, multiple servers

If you are running your Laravel site on multiple hosts behind a load balancer, simply put the respective name of each host in your .env file.

```dotenv
APPKEEP_SERVER_NAME=eu-server1
```

### Writing your own checks

TBD
