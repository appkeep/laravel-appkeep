[App:keep](https://appkeep.co) is a monitoring solution. It's very easy to install and has a small footprint. The monitors run in a scheduled artisan command and submit the results to App:keep servers over a secure connection.

Using App:keep's UI, you can monitor many Laravel applications from a single interface, receive Slack or email alerts, and more. It's still being actively developed. [Join our private beta.](https://appkeep.co)
